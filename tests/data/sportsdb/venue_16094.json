It is the home stadium of the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL) and the Temple Owls football team of Temple University. The stadium is located in South Philadelphia on Pattison Avenue between 11th and South Darien streets alongside I-95. It is part of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex and has a seating capacity of 67,594.\r\n\r\nThe stadium opened on August 3, 2003, after two years of construction that began on May 7, 2001, replacing Veterans Stadium, which opened in 1971 and served as the home field for both the Eagles and Philadelphia Phillies through 2002 and 2003, respectively. While total seating capacity is similar to that of Veterans Stadium, the new stadium includes double the number of luxury and wheelchair-accessible seats and more modern services. The field's construction included several LED video displays and more than 624 feet (190 m) of LED ribbon boards.\r\n\r\nNaming rights were sold in June 2002 to the Lincoln Financial Group, for a sum of $139.6 million over 21 years. The City of Philadelphia and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania cumulatively contributed approximately $188 million in public funding to the stadium construction. Additional construction funding was raised from the sale of stadium builder's licenses, which are necessary to purchase season tickets for some of the stadium's best seating levels.\r\n\r\nThe Army–Navy football game is frequently played at the stadium due to Philadelphia being located halfway between both service academies, the stadium being able to house the large crowds in attendance, and the historic nature of the city. Temple University's Division I college football team also plays their home games at Lincoln Financial Field, paying the Eagles $3 million a year to do so as of February 2020. The Philadelphia Union of Major League Soccer have played exhibition games here against high-profile international clubs when their stadium Subaru Park does not provide adequate seating. The stadium also plays host to several soccer games each year and will host matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup. It has also played host to the NCAA lacrosse national championship five times: 2005, 2006, 2013, 2019, and 2023.","strArchitect":"NBBJ","intCapacity":"69176","strCost":"$512 million","strCountry":"United States","strLocation":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","strTimezone":"UTC-04:00","intFormedYear":"2003","strFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/venue\/fanart\/kx1liz1721472431.jpg","strFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/venue\/fanart\/x6cvfu1721472437.jpg","strFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/venue\/fanart\/u2a0gs1721472458.jpg","strFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/venue\/fanart\/fxvm7y1721472446.jpg","strThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/venue\/thumb\/rz76hf1721472451.jpg","strLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/venue\/logo\/4zn8ra1721472518.png","strMap":"39°54′3″N 75°10′3″W","strWebsite":"www.lincolnfinancialfield.com","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/lincolnfinancialfield","strInstagram":"","strTwitter":"x.com\/LFFStadium","strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
